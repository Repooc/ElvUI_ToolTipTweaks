v1.05 10/23/2024

• bump toc
• NEW: Add ability to offset the health bar of units to provide some space between it and the rest of the tooltip frame, useful for addons that alter the border and that border is a bit bigger
• Reworked the main function of the addon which was to provide a way to alter the offset of the tooltip where people wanted to remove the gap at the bottom of the screen. This has been expanded a lot now and will need to be adjusted as you see fit.
