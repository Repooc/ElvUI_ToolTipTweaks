Do you want to be able to make slight adjustments for the tooltip while using ElvUI, like that gap of 18 pixels from the ToolTip Mover?

**ElvUI ToolTip Tweaks** is the solution! This ElvUI plugin allows you to adjust the tooltip's padding to be closer together or even more further apart! You have the ability to decide if you want to account for the default padding values ElvUI uses in addition to the values you set in the plugin or just the raw value from the plugin itself, it's all up to you! Take that control of your tooltips now and download ElvUI ToolTip Tweaks!

### Features:
- **Simplified Options:** The main options are all located in its own section under the Repooc Reforged Plugins section then under ToolTip Tweaks section.

### Future Updates:
I strive to keep ElvUI ToolTip Tweaks up to everyone's needs. While I welcome and value your feedback, please understand that not all suggestions may be implemented. I'll carefully consider each idea for additional customization options and features, ensuring that any future updates align with the essence of this plugin which is aimed at making small adjustments that ElvUI sets currently, to be optional and have a little bit more control.

Your input is crucial in shaping the journey of this addon. Thank you for being part of the community driving its growth!
